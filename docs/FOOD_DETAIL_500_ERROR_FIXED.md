# Food Detail Page 500 Error - FIXED

## Issue Summary
The food detail page for ID 14 (http://localhost/buffet_booking_mvc/food/detail/14) was showing a 500 error due to missing database table and controller issues.

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Database Table
**Problem**: The `hasUserLiked()` method was trying to query a non-existent `review_likes` table.
**Solution**: Created the `review_likes` table with proper structure and foreign key constraints.

### 2. ✅ Controller Debug Output (Previously Fixed)
**Problem**: Debug echo statements causing premature output.
**Solution**: Removed all debug output from FoodController.php.

### 3. ✅ Session Variable Inconsistency (Previously Fixed)
**Problem**: Mixed usage of `$_SESSION['user']` and `$_SESSION['user_id']`.
**Solution**: Standardized to use `$_SESSION['user_id']` consistently.

## Files Modified

### 1. **database/create_review_likes_table.sql** (NEW)
- Created SQL script to create the missing `review_likes` table
- Includes proper foreign key constraints and indexes

### 2. **create_review_likes_table.php** (NEW)
- PHP script to execute the table creation
- Successfully created the table in the database

### 3. **controllers/FoodController.php** (UPDATED)
- Restored full functionality for the `hasUserLiked()` method
- Now properly populates `liked` status for each comment

### 4. **test_food_detail_final.php** (NEW)
- Comprehensive test script to verify all functionality
- All tests passing ✅

## Database Table Created

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `review_likes` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `user_id` int NOT NULL,
  `review_id` int NOT NULL,
  `created_at` timestamp NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `unique_user_review` (`user_id`, `review_id`),
  KEY `fk_review_likes_user` (`user_id`),
  KEY `fk_review_likes_review` (`review_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `fk_review_likes_user` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `users` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  CONSTRAINT `fk_review_likes_review` FOREIGN KEY (`review_id`) REFERENCES `reviews` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```
