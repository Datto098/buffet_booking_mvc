# MENU PAGE ERROR FIX - COMPLETED

## Issue Description
The customer menu page was generating PHP warnings due to undefined array keys:
- `discount_percentage` field was referenced but doesn't exist in the `food_items` database table
- `discounted_price` field was referenced but doesn't exist in the `food_items` database table
- `image_url` field was referenced but the actual column name is `image`

## Root Cause Analysis
After checking the `food_items` table structure, confirmed that:
- The table has an `image` column, not `image_url`
- The table does NOT have `discount_percentage` or `discounted_price` columns
- The menu view was trying to access non-existent fields

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Image Field Reference
**File:** `views/customer/menu/index.php`
**Change:**
```php
// BEFORE:
$food['image_url']

// AFTER:
$food['image']
```

### 2. Removed Discount Badge Display
**File:** `views/customer/menu/index.php`
**Removed:**
```php
<?php if ($food['discount_percentage'] > 0): ?>
    <span class="badge bg-danger position-absolute top-0 end-0 m-2">
        -<?= $food['discount_percentage'] ?>%
    </span>
<?php endif; ?>
```

### 3. Simplified Price Display
**File:** `views/customer/menu/index.php`
**Change:**
```php
// BEFORE: Complex discount logic
<?php if ($food['discount_percentage'] > 0): ?>
    <span class="text-decoration-line-through text-muted">
        <?= number_format($food['price'], 0, ',', '.') ?>đ
    </span>
    <span class="h5 text-danger ms-2">
        <?= number_format($food['discounted_price'], 0, ',', '.') ?>đ
    </span>
<?php else: ?>
    <span class="h5 text-primary">
        <?= number_format($food['price'], 0, ',', '.') ?>đ
    </span>
<?php endif; ?>

// AFTER: Simple price display
<span class="h5 text-primary">
    <?= number_format($food['price'], 0, ',', '.') ?>đ
</span>
```

### 4. Fixed Add to Cart Button Data
**File:** `views/customer/menu/index.php`
**Change:**
```php
// BEFORE:
data-food-price="<?= $food['discounted_price'] ?? $food['price'] ?>"

// AFTER:
data-food-price="<?= $food['price'] ?>"
```

## Verification Results
