# Buffet Booking MVC - Bugfix Report

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Menu Filtering 500 Error
- **Problem**: HTTP 500 error when filtering food items on the menu page
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed ambiguous column names in SQL queries
  - Added table aliases to the filter conditions in FoodController
  - Updated sorting parameters to include table aliases
  - Fixed the `countFoodWithFilters` method in the Food model

### 2. Booking System Error with Party Size Selection
- **Problem**: Error when users select the number of guests on the booking page
- **Solution**:
  - Added error handling in the `getAvailableTables` method to check if tables table exists
  - Added try-catch block in the `checkAvailability` method to handle exceptions gracefully
  - Fixed the error by returning a user-friendly message when tables don't exist
  - Fixed field name mismatches between the controller and model
  - Updated the `createBooking` method to handle different field naming conventions
  - Updated the controller to use the correct `createBookingFromController` method

### 3. Header/Footer Duplication in Customer View Files
- **Problem**: Header and footer were directly included in multiple view files
- **Solution**:
  - Removed direct header/footer includes from customer view files
  - Used BaseController's loadView method for template consistency
  - Added proper documentation comments to the view files

## Testing and Verification

### Database Setup
- Created necessary database tables for testing (`tables` and `reservations`)
- Added sample table records with different capacities

### Booking System Tests
- Created test scripts to verify the booking functionality:
  - Tested `getAvailableTables` with different party sizes
  - Tested `checkAvailability` to ensure it handles errors gracefully
  - Verified that the booking system can handle cases when tables don't exist

### Error Handling Verification
- Confirmed that the application now handles errors properly
- Verified that user-friendly messages are displayed instead of technical errors

## Future Improvements

1. **Table Management**:
   - Add admin interface for managing tables (add, edit, delete)
   - Implement table layout visualization

2. **Reservation System**:
   - Implement email notifications for booking confirmations
   - Add SMS notifications for booking reminders

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize database queries for better performance
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data

## Summary

All major issues have been addressed and the application is now functioning correctly. The error handling has been improved to provide better user experience, and the code structure has been standardized for easier maintenance.

The booking system now correctly handles various edge cases and provides appropriate feedback to users when selecting party sizes or checking availability.
